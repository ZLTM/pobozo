Game made following the theme "Ritual", it showcases the Bolivian culture old rituals by putting the player in the shoes of a yatiri (kind of like a shaman) accomplishing this using the movement tracking of [MYO](https://www.myo.com/).

## Important
**Due to legal issues I'm no longer able to provide the game exe, however I can still show the code.**

## Participation

In this project I was able to participate together with the bolivian game studio GESH as a:

* Game Designer: My first time designing a rythm game, also my first time using movement tracking.
* Programer: Developed the rythm mechanic, helped with the demons movement.

## Installation

Windows:

This game requires [MYO](https://www.myo.com/), after instaling it just open the game and play!


## Gameplay

As the hordes of demons aproaches you will purify them by moving your hands at the rythm of the beat marked by the circle.
